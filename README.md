# Resume MCP Server

Let's get a Resume MCP server up-and-running on Cloudflare Workers with Descope OAuth login!

## Preview

This MCP Server is deployed to Cloudflare Workers here: [https://resume-mcp-server.descope-cx.workers.dev/](https://resume-mcp-server.descope-cx.workers.dev/)

You can connect to the server using the [Cloudflare Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/), [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) or any other MCP client. Be sure to include the `/sse` path in the connection URL.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A [Descope](https://www.descope.com/) account and project
- Node.js version `18.x` or higher
- A Cloudflare account (for deployment)

## Develop locally

1. Get your credentials from the Descope Console:
   - [Project ID](https://app.descope.com/settings/project)
   - [Management Key](https://app.descope.com/settings/company/managementkeys)

2. Create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root (this file is gitignored):

```bash
# .dev.vars
DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY="your_management_key"
# For local development
SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8787"
# For production (replace with your worker URL)
# SERVER_URL="https://mcp-server-delegated-auth-descope.your-account-name.workers.dev"
```

3. Clone and set up the repository:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume-mcp-from-weather.git

# install dependencies
cd resume-mcp-from-weather
pnpm i

# run locally
pnpm dev
```

You should be able to open [`http://localhost:8787/`](http://localhost:8787/) in your browser

## Connect the MCP inspector to your server

To explore your new MCP api, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

1. Start it with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
2. [Within the inspector](http://localhost:5173), switch the Transport Type to `SSE` and enter `http://localhost:8787/sse` as the URL of the MCP server to connect to.
3. Add a bearer token and click "Connect"
4. Click "List Tools"
5. Run the "getToken" tool, which should return the Authorization header that you set in the inspector

## Connect Claude Desktop to your local MCP server

## Deploy to Cloudflare

1. Set up your secrets in Cloudflare:

```bash
wrangler secret put DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY
```

2. Add the following to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

```jsonc
{
 "vars": {
  "DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID": "your_project_id",
  "SERVER_URL": "your_server_url"
 }
}
```

3. Deploy the worker:

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

## Call your newly deployed remote MCP server from a remote MCP client

Just like you did above in "Develop locally", run the MCP inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
```

Then enter the `workers.dev` URL (ex: `worker-name.account-name.workers.dev/sse`) of your Worker in the inspector as the URL of the MCP server to connect to, and click "Connect".

You've now connected to your MCP server from a remote MCP client. You can pass in a bearer token like mentioned above.

## Debugging

Should anything go wrong it can be helpful to restart Claude, or to try connecting directly to your
MCP server on the command line with the following command.

```bash
npx mcp-remote http://localhost:8787/sse
```

In some rare cases it may help to clear the files added to `~/.mcp-auth`

```bash
rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth
```
